## *SMART-seq* _Switching Mechanism At the end of the 5′-end of the RNA Transcript_
SMART-seq uses a mechanism called _Template Switching_ to generate cDNA libraries. It relies on   
the RT of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) and tagmentation to construct the sequencing libraries.

* *MMLV RT cDNA synthesis* 
   The RNA is hybridized to an oligo (dT)- primer and 1st cDNA strand is 
   synthesized through the MMLV RT. It adds additional _deoxyC’s_ at the very end of the transcript _(5’ end)_. 
* *Template Switching*
   These extra _C’s_ are crucial for the template switching oligo _(TSO)_, which involve
   an oligonucleotide _(same sequence as primer above)_, 2 _riboG_ and a locked nucleic acid _(LNA)_-modified G,  
   which enhances thermal stability and strongly anneal to the untemplated 3’ extension of the cDNA. This will 
   allow the RT to switch template strands from mRNA to TSO to generate second 5’ to 3’ strand. PCR is carried out with only 1 primer.
* *Tagmentation* 
   DNA is simultaneously tagged and fragmented by a hyperactive _Tn5 transposase_ which carries out the fragmentation
   of dsDNA and ligates synthetic tags at both ends. A second PCR is carried out to construct the sequencing libraries.
